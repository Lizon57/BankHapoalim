# Comments Proj

The project made for a job appealing as part of 24 hours test.

# Technology used

* Angular (by [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.11.)
* Scss

# Motivation
For sure, a big part of the motivation for creating this proj is the job appealing-test, although 
it was a great journy of study and pressure.

## Improvemant skills
Because I usually write React, this project improved my Angular skills, as I learend deeper and wider how's angular works.

## Time limit
In addition to this proj, I got 10 more questions (some theories and some practical).
Dealing with this proj, as well as rest of the questions, while I still works, and still learning angular basics, was a big adventure.


# Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

# Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

# Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

# Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
